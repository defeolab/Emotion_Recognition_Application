"""Simple GUI for recording into a WAV file.
There are 3 concurrent activities: GUI, audio callback, file-writing thread.
Neither the GUI nor the audio callback is supposed to block.
Blocking in any of the GUI functions could make the GUI "freeze", blocking in
the audio callback could lead to drop-outs in the recording.
Blocking the file-writing thread for some time is no problem, as long as the
recording can be stopped successfully when it is supposed to.
